# Kezaco

Trading strategy for Binance that 'rides' the winning cryptocurrencies of the day to generate a quick profit. By entering these cryptocurrencies, it is assumed that there is a higher chance of them continuing to rise before correcting, rather than dropping immediately after entry.

The strategy will check for the following entry conditions:

 - The cryptocurrency is winning
 - The cryptocurrency is in a strong uptrend (1-hour green candle with no wick)

If these two conditions are met, the trade will be initiated.
